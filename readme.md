# The Agency Web Page
Still thinkin

Hints:
 - Basic Encryption Methods - Binary, caesar cipher
 - Basic stuff like base 64 encoded stuff
 - On IP
 - Binary to ASCII
 - Latitude and Longitude
 - Morse Code - could be audio, written, flashing (epilepsy warning but it could be like a little dot on the screen)
 - Reversed audio
 - Geocache type thing - If nate is in the club, nate can do it if he wants. Otherwise it's a bit far-fetched and tough to pull off. Not impossible though. We also don't know if people are interested.

# Theme:
The Agency

# How to make people interested
 - Not many words
 - Symbolism



# Two paths:
Allude to some of the solutions by referencing it nearby, but not directly related to the challenge
## Easy Path (Basic Cryptography, Maybe IP addresses, Heirophyphs and stuff, ):
 - Go to website
 - Inspect Element Code Text Comment
 - Cryptography (caesar cipher, morse code)
 - Binary conversion to ascii (maybe too hard?)
 - Image with password on sticky note
 - Play Pong or do Maze for reward
 - Osint like social media page for some worker of the agency
 - Fake Linked in?
## Hard Path (IP addresses, Linux basics, Audio Spectrogram stuff, Networking basics):
 - Gain Root access to a computer with files
 - Latitude and Longitude
 - Image hidden in Audio Spectrogram https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnzIpAAzP3w 
 - Wifi Router in Lab with some local IP address hosting an http server with data
 - Hide stuff in metadata for picture
 - Hide data inside an image (steganography)
