## Easy Path (Basic Cryptography, Maybe IP addresses, Heirophyphs and stuff, ):
 - Go to website
 - Inspect Element Code Text Comment
 - Cryptography (caesar cipher, morse code)
 - Binary conversion to ascii (maybe too hard?)
 - Image with password on sticky note
 - Play Pong or do Maze for reward
 - Osint like social media page for some worker of the agency
 - Fake Linked in?
## Hard Path (IP addresses, Linux basics, Audio Spectrogram stuff, Networking basics):
 - Gain Root access to a computer with files
 - Latitude and Longitude
 - Image hidden in Audio Spectrogram https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnzIpAAzP3w 
 - Wifi Router in Lab with some local IP address hosting an http server with data
